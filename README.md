# 📝 Text Summarizer using Huggingface Transformers

A domain-adaptable, lightweight, and production-ready text summarization app built using Huggingface models like BART/T5 — complete with a training pipeline, prediction API, and web interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end text summarization system capable of handling large-scale documents, research articles, or domain-specific content (legal, medical, news, etc.). Unlike generic tools like ChatGPT, this app is tailored for enterprise, offline, or scalable summarization needs.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **NLP Models**: Huggingface Transformers 
- **Pipelines**: YAML-based modular training + prediction
- **Web Framework**: Flask (API + Frontend)
- **Others**: PyTorch, Pandas, Numpy, MLflow (optional), DVC (optional)
